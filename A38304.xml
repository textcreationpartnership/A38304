         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE doubt not but the World believes that, in this Great and Dangerous Conjuncture, VVe are heartily and zealouſly concerned for the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject. And VVe did reaſonably hope, that the King having Iſſued His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and VVrits for a Free Parliament, VVe might have reſted Secure under the Expectation of that Meeting: But His Majeſty having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn Himſelf, and as VVe apprehend, in order to His Departure out of this Kingdom, by the Pernicious Counſels of Perſons ill Affected to Our Nation and Religion, VVe cannot, without being wanting to Our Duty, be ſilent under thoſe Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wherein the Popiſh Counſels which ſo long prevailed, have miſerably involved theſe Realms. VVe do therefore Unanimouſly reſolve to apply Our Selves to His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who with ſo great Kindneſs to theſe Kingdoms, ſo vaſt Expence, and ſo much hazard to his own Perſon, hath Undertaken, by endeavouring to Procure a Free Parliament, to reſcue Us, with as little Effuſion, as poſſible, of Chriſtian Blood from the imminent Dangers of Popery and Slavery.</p>
            <p>And VVe do hereby Declare, That VVe will, with our utmoſt Endeavours, aſſiſt his Highneſs in the obtaining ſuch a Parliament with all ſpeed, wherein Our Laws, Our Liberties and Properties may be ſecured, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, with a due Liberty to Proteſtant Diſſenters, and in general the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt over the whole VVorld may be Supported and Encouraged, to the Glory of God, the Happineſs of the Eſtabliſhed Government in theſe Kingdoms, and the Advantage of all Princes and States in Chriſtendom, that may be herein concerned.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, VVe will Endeavour to Preſerve, as much as in Us lies, the Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of theſe great and populous Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Parts Adjacent, by taking Care to Diſarm all Papiſts, and Secure all Jeſuits and Romiſh Prieſts who are in or about the ſame.</p>
            <p>And if there be any thing more to be performed by Us, for promoting His Highneſs's Generous Intentions for the Publick Good, VVe ſhall be ready to do it as occaſion ſhall Require.</p>
